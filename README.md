2. **ErrorExample** — learn how ZIO models and recovers from errors
3. **RefExample** — learn how ZIO handles mutable state safely
4. **ScheduleExample** — repeat and retry effects with policies
5. **LayerExample** — structure your app with dependency injection
6. **ScopeExample** — manage resources (files, connections) safely
7. **StreamExample** — process sequences of data
8. **SemaphoreExample** — limit how many fibers run concurrently
9. **QueueExample** — send messages between fibers
10. **HubExample** — broadcast messages to multiple consumers

## Example Guide

### 1. MainApp — ZIO Basics

> **Core idea:** A `ZIO[R, E, A]` is a description of a program that needs an environment `R`, may fail with `E`, or succeed with `A`. Nothing runs until you provide it to a runtime.

```scala
object MainApp extends ZIOAppDefault:
  def run = myAppLogic
```

`ZIOAppDefault` is the simplest way to run a ZIO program. You define a `run` method that returns a ZIO effect, and the framework handles the rest.

**What you will learn:**

- **Console I/O** — `Console.printLine` and `Console.readLine` are ZIO effects, not side effects. They return `ZIO` values that describe what to do, and the runtime executes them.
- **for-comprehension** — chain multiple effects sequentially. Each `<-` runs an effect and binds its result. This is how you compose ZIO programs step by step.
- **Fiber** — lightweight virtual threads managed by ZIO. Use `.fork` to start a fiber and `.join` to wait for its result. Two fibers forked at the same time run concurrently.
- **Error handling** — `ZIO.fail` creates a failed effect. `.fold` lets you handle both success and failure in one expression, converting the effect into a value that always succeeds.

**Key type:**

```
ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit]
     │       │        └─ success type: produces Unit (nothing)
     │       └────────── error type: may throw
     └────────────────── environment: needs nothing
```

### 2. Ref — Thread-safe Mutable State

> **Core idea:** `Ref` is an atomic mutable reference. All operations are thread-safe — you never need locks.

**Why not just use `var`?** In concurrent programs, multiple fibers reading and writing a `var` causes race conditions. `Ref` guarantees that every `update` is atomic, even with thousands of fibers running in parallel.

**What you will learn:**

- **`Ref.make(0)`** — create a Ref with an initial value
- **`get` / `set`** — read and write the value
- **`update(_ + 1)`** — atomically apply a function to the current value
- **`updateAndGet`** — same as `update`, but also returns the new value
- **`modify`** — atomically update the state AND return a derived value. This is the most powerful operation:

```scala
// Withdraw money: return the withdrawn amount AND update the balance
ref.modify { balance =>
  if balance >= 30 then (30, balance - 30)  // (return value, new state)
  else (0, balance)                          // insufficient funds
}
```

- **Concurrent safety** — the example runs 1000 parallel increments and always gets exactly 1000
- **State machine** — model state transitions (Red → Green → Yellow → Red) with `Ref` + ADT

---

### 3. Schedule — Repeat and Retry

> **Core idea:** A `Schedule` is a reusable policy that describes when and how often to repeat or retry an effect.

**What you will learn:**

- **`repeat`** — run a successful effect multiple times. `effect.repeat(Schedule.recurs(4))` runs it 1 + 4 = 5 times total (1 initial + 4 repeats).
- **`retry`** — re-run a failed effect. The effect runs once, and if it fails, the schedule determines if and when to retry.
- **Schedule composition:**
  - `&&` (intersection) — both schedules must agree to continue. Useful for "retry up to 3 times with 100ms spacing".
  - `||` (union) — either schedule can continue. Useful for "retry for 10 seconds OR up to 5 times".
- **`retryOrElse`** — retry with a fallback value when all retries are exhausted
- **`collectAll`** — collect every schedule output (the recurrence index) into a `Chunk`

**Common patterns:**

```scala
// Retry 5 times
effect.retry(Schedule.recurs(5))

// Retry with exponential backoff, up to 10 times
effect.retry(Schedule.exponential(100.millis) && Schedule.recurs(10))

// Retry, or fall back to a default
effect.retryOrElse(Schedule.recurs(3), (err, _) => ZIO.succeed(default))
```

---

### 4. ZLayer — Dependency Injection

> **Core idea:** `ZLayer` is ZIO's built-in dependency injection. You define services as traits, implement them as classes, and wire them together with layers.

**The three-step pattern:**

```
1. Define a trait        →  trait UserRepo { def getUser(id: Int): ... }
2. Implement it          →  case class UserRepoLive() extends UserRepo { ... }
3. Create a ZLayer       →  val live: ULayer[UserRepo] = ZLayer.succeed(UserRepoLive())
```

**What you will learn:**

- **`ZIO.service[UserRepo]`** — request a service from the environment. Your business logic declares what it needs, not how to get it.
- **`.provide(layer1, layer2)`** — supply the required layers to a ZIO effect. ZIO checks at compile time that all dependencies are satisfied.
- **Test layer swapping** — in tests, replace `EmailServiceLive` with a mock that does nothing. This is why separating trait from implementation matters.

**Why this matters:** Instead of passing dependencies manually through constructors, ZIO resolves them automatically. If your program needs `UserRepo & EmailService`, you just `.provide` both layers and ZIO wires them up.

---

### 5. Scope — Resource Management

> **Core idea:** `ZIO.acquireRelease` ensures that a resource is always released, even if the program fails or is interrupted. You never forget to close a file or connection.

**The problem:** Opening a file and then crashing before closing it leaks the resource. Try/finally works but doesn't compose well with concurrent code.

**What you will learn:**

- **`ZIO.acquireRelease(acquire)(release)`** — pair acquisition with guaranteed cleanup
- **`ZIO.scoped { ... }`** — define a region where scoped resources live. When the block ends, all resources are released automatically.
- **Reverse release order** — if you acquire A then B, they are released in order B then A. This is important for dependent resources (close the cache before the database).
- **Safety on failure** — even if the effect fails with an error, the release still runs
- **`ZLayer.scoped`** — create a ZLayer from a scoped resource. The resource lives as long as the layer is in use.

```scala
// Resource is acquired, used, and automatically released
ZIO.scoped {
  for
    conn <- ZIO.acquireRelease(openConnection)(_.close)
    _    <- useConnection(conn)
  yield ()
}
// conn is guaranteed to be closed here
```

---

### 6. ZIO Streams — Processing Data Sequences

> **Core idea:** `ZStream` is a lazy, pull-based sequence of values that can be transformed and consumed efficiently. Think of it as a functional, effectful iterator.

**Three core types:**

| Type | Role | Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| `ZStream` | Produces elements | A garden hose |
| `ZPipeline` | Transforms elements | A filter attached to the hose |
| `ZSink` | Consumes elements | A bucket at the end |

**What you will learn:**

- **`ZStream.fromIterable`** — create a stream from a collection
- **`.map` / `.filter`** — transform and filter elements (just like on a `List`)
- **`ZPipeline`** — composable transformations. Chain them with `>>>`:
  ```scala
  val pipeline = ZPipeline.map[Int, Int](_ * 2) >>> ZPipeline.map[Int, String](_.toString)
  stream.via(pipeline)
  ```
- **`ZSink.sum`** — consume a stream and return the sum of all elements
- **`.grouped(5)`** — batch elements into chunks of 5
- **`ZStream.unfold`** — generate an infinite stream from a seed (the example generates Fibonacci numbers)
- **`.merge`** — run two streams concurrently and interleave their elements

---

### 7. Queue — Communication Between Fibers

> **Core idea:** `Queue` is a concurrent, back-pressured channel for sending values between fibers. One fiber produces, another consumes.

**Queue vs Hub:** Queue distributes each message to exactly one consumer (load balancing). Hub broadcasts each message to all subscribers.

**What you will learn:**

- **`Queue.bounded(n)`** — create a queue with a maximum capacity. When full, `offer` suspends until space is available (back-pressure).
- **`Queue.unbounded`** — no capacity limit (use with caution)
- **`offer` / `take`** — put an element in / take an element out. `take` suspends if the queue is empty.
- **Producer-consumer** — a classic pattern: producer and consumer run as separate fibers, communicating through the queue.
- **`takeAll` / `takeUpTo(n)`** — batch operations for consuming multiple elements at once
- **`poll`** — non-blocking take. Returns `None` if the queue is empty instead of suspending.
- **Back-pressure** — the example shows how `offer` on a full bounded queue suspends the calling fiber, which naturally slows down the producer to match the consumer's speed.

```
Producer fiber                     Consumer fiber
     │                                  │
     ├── offer(1) ──► [ Queue ] ──► take ──┤
     ├── offer(2) ──►           ──► take ──┤
     └── offer(3) ──►           ──► take ──┘
```

---

### 8. Hub — Broadcasting to Multiple Consumers

> **Core idea:** `Hub` is a concurrent pub/sub primitive. Every message published to the Hub is delivered to **all** subscribers.

**Queue vs Hub:**

```
Queue:  publish("A") → only ONE consumer gets "A"
Hub:    publish("A") → ALL subscribers get "A"
```

**What you will learn:**

- **`Hub.bounded(n)`** — create a hub with a buffer capacity
- **`hub.subscribe`** — returns a scoped `Dequeue` (read-only queue). Each subscription receives its own copy of every published message. Must be used inside `ZIO.scoped`.
- **`hub.publish`** — send a message to all current subscribers
- **Fan-out processing** — different subscribers process the same data differently (e.g., one calculates a sum, another logs values)
- **Concurrent pub/sub** — publisher and consumers run as separate fibers

```scala
Hub.bounded[String](4).flatMap { hub =>
  ZIO.scoped {
    hub.subscribe.zip(hub.subscribe).flatMap { case (sub1, sub2) =>
      for
        _ <- hub.publish("Hello")
        a <- sub1.take  // gets "Hello"
        b <- sub2.take  // also gets "Hello"
      yield ()
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 9. Promise — One-time Fiber Synchronization

> **Core idea:** `Promise` is a single-value container that starts empty and can be completed exactly once. Any fiber that calls `await` on an incomplete Promise will suspend until it is completed.

**Promise vs Ref:** `Ref` can be updated many times. `Promise` is write-once — after `succeed` or `fail`, the value never changes.

**What you will learn:**

- **`Promise.make[E, A]`** — create an empty promise with error type `E` and value type `A`
- **`succeed` / `fail`** — complete the promise with a value or an error. The second call is ignored (idempotent).
- **`await`** — suspend the current fiber until the promise is completed. Multiple fibers can `await` the same promise.
- **`isDone`** — check whether the promise has been completed, without blocking
- **Gate pattern** — a common coordination pattern: multiple worker fibers all `await` the same promise. When you call `gate.succeed(())`, all workers start simultaneously.
- **Handoff** — one fiber computes a result and passes it to another fiber through a promise

```scala
// Gate pattern: 3 workers wait for a signal
val program = for
  gate   <- Promise.make[Nothing, Unit]
  fibers <- ZIO.foreach(1 to 3)(id => (gate.await *> doWork(id)).fork)
  _      <- gate.succeed(())  // open the gate — all 3 workers start
  _      <- ZIO.foreach(fibers)(_.join)
yield ()
```

---

### 10. STM — Software Transactional Memory

> **Core idea:** STM lets you compose multiple state changes into a single atomic transaction. Either all changes apply, or none do — even under concurrency.

**Why not just use Ref?** `Ref` makes individual operations atomic, but composing multiple `Ref` updates is not atomic. For example, transferring money between two accounts requires updating both — if the program crashes between the two updates, the money disappears. STM solves this.

**What you will learn:**

- **`TRef`** — a transactional reference, like `Ref` but for use inside STM transactions
- **`STM` monad** — compose multiple reads and writes into a single transaction using for-comprehensions
- **`.commit`** — submit the transaction to be executed atomically as a `ZIO` effect
- **`STM.fail`** — abort the transaction (like a rollback)
- **`TMap`** — a transactional map with atomic `put`, `get`, and `merge` operations
- **Concurrent consistency** — the example runs 100 concurrent round-trip transfers and proves the total balance never changes

```scala
// Atomic money transfer — both accounts update together or not at all
def transfer(from: TRef[Long], to: TRef[Long], amount: Long): STM[String, Unit] =
  for
    balance <- from.get
    _       <- if balance < amount then STM.fail("Insufficient funds") else STM.unit
    _       <- from.update(_ - amount)
    _       <- to.update(_ + amount)
  yield ()

// Execute the transaction
transfer(alice, bob, 300L).commit
```

---

### 11. Semaphore — Limiting Concurrency

> **Core idea:** A `Semaphore` controls how many fibers can run a section of code at the same time. It has a fixed number of "permits" — a fiber must acquire a permit before proceeding and releases it when done.

**Real-world analogy:** A parking lot with 5 spaces. Cars (fibers) must wait at the entrance when all spaces (permits) are taken. When a car leaves, the next one can enter.

**What you will learn:**

- **`Semaphore.make(permits = N)`** — create a semaphore with N permits
- **`withPermit`** — acquire one permit, run the effect, and automatically release the permit when done (even on failure). This is the most common operation:

```scala
val sem = Semaphore.make(permits = 3)
// at most 3 fibers execute this block simultaneously
sem.withPermit {
  callExternalApi()
}
```

- **Mutex** — a semaphore with 1 permit is a mutex (exclusive lock). Only one fiber can enter at a time. The example proves no two fibers overlap.
- **`withPermits(n)`** — acquire multiple permits at once. Useful when a "heavy" task needs more resources than a "light" task.
- **`available`** — check how many permits are currently free, without blocking

**Common patterns:**

```scala
// Rate limiter: at most 10 concurrent API calls
val limiter = Semaphore.make(permits = 10)
ZIO.foreachPar(urls)(url => limiter.withPermit(fetch(url)))

// Mixed workloads: heavy tasks need 3 permits, light tasks need 1
sem.withPermits(3)(heavyTask)
sem.withPermit(lightTask)
```

---

### 12. Error Handling — Failures, Defects & Recovery

> **Core idea:** ZIO distinguishes between **failures** (expected, typed errors in the `E` channel) and **defects** (unexpected bugs that crash the fiber). This lets you handle business errors precisely and let real bugs surface.

**Failures vs Defects:**

| | Failure | Defect |
|---|---|---|
| Created by | `ZIO.fail(value)` | `ZIO.die(exception)`, thrown in unsafe code |
| Visible in type | Yes — `ZIO[R, E, A]` | No — not in the type signature |
| Caught by `catchAll` | Yes | No |
| Caught by `catchAllCause` | Yes | Yes |
| Intent | Business error (not found, validation) | Bug (null pointer, assertion) |

**What you will learn:**

- **Typed error hierarchy** — define a `sealed trait AppError` with case classes for each error. The compiler ensures you handle every case:

```scala
sealed trait AppError
case class NotFound(id: String)        extends AppError
case class ValidationError(msg: String) extends AppError
```

- **`catchAll`** — handle all typed errors, must be exhaustive
- **`catchSome`** — handle only specific errors via partial function, unmatched errors propagate
- **`mapError`** — transform the error type (e.g., `AppError` → `String`)
- **`orElse`** — try a fallback effect when the first one fails
- **`fold` / `foldZIO`** — handle both success and failure in one expression. `foldZIO` allows effectful recovery.
- **`ZIO.attempt`** — convert code that throws exceptions into a `ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]`, moving exceptions into the error channel
- **`refineToOrDie`** — narrow a broad error type (`Throwable`) to a specific one (`NumberFormatException`). Errors that don't match become defects.
- **`Cause`** — the full story of why an effect failed, including failures, defects, and interruptions
- **`catchAllCause`** — catch everything including defects. Use `cause.isDie` to distinguish defects from failures.

```scala
// Typed error handling — compiler verifies exhaustiveness
findUser(id).catchAll {
  case NotFound(id)       => ZIO.succeed(defaultUser)
  case ValidationError(m) => ZIO.succeed(errorResponse(m))
}

// Convert exceptions → typed errors
ZIO.attempt(Integer.parseInt(input))
  .refineToOrDie[NumberFormatException]
```
